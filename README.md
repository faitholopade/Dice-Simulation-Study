# Dice-Simulation-Study
STU22005 Applied Probability Project Question 1:

A 12-sided die is rolled continuously until all the possible outcomes have occurred at least
once.
- Estimate the expected number of dice rolls needed using a simulation study.
- Compute the expected number of dice rolls needed analytically.

A pair of 6-sided fair dice are rolled continuously until all the possible outcomes (i.e. all
possible sums of two dice, 2, 3, . . . , 12) have occurred at
